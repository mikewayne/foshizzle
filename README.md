Snoop Dogg popularized the phrase "fo shizzle" in the American pop culture lexicon.

One of his main tenets of his way of speech is that he oftentimes changes the letter "s" to "z."

Write a Ruby method on the String class that changes the letter 's' to the letter 'z' in all of the words in a string 
unless it is either capitalized or it is the first letter of the word.

Sample input/output: 

In: "Sally sells seashells on the seashore." 

Out: "Sally sellz seazhellz on the seaszhore."
